# CDBSMOTE
CDBSMOTE(=Class and Density Based Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) is a result of a convergence between machine learning algorithms(Decision Tree, DBSCAN) and an educational engineering(JIGSAW).

## Core idea
* Through a JIGSAW model from educational engineering, the output of the mutual teaching between the Decision Tree and the DBSCAN can find a low density point. It is a key point for the data augmentation.
